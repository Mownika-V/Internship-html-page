         <p>Giv.e me one ,.good reason why I should give up my limited spare time to come to your Science Week event! While you‚Äôre at it, give me a few good reasons.

            A strong and clear event description excites punters: tell them what will happen at the event, who will be speaking, and what they might get out of attending. Your event may be brilliant, but no one else will know without you telling and convincing them.
           
            Good event descriptions can also lead to more media coverage. This is important‚Äîboth for encouraging people to attend events and for talking about science with a broader audience. The descriptions of registered events give the publicity team material to work with and provide journalists with leads for events and speakers that might make good stories.</p>
